What is Tkinter in Python?

Tk is called Tkinter in Python, or to be precise, Tkinter is the Python interface for Tk. Tkinter is an acronym for "Tk interface".Tk was developed as a GUI extension for the Tcl scripting language by John Ousterhout. The first release was in 1991. Tk proved as extremely successful in the 1990's, because it is easier to learn and to use than other toolkits. So it is no wonder that many programmers wanted to use Tk independently of Tcl. That's why bindings for lots of other programming languages have been developed, including Perl, Ada (called TASH), Python (called Tkinter), Ruby, and Common Lisp.
Why use Tkinter for GUI applications?
Tkinter gives the programmer ease of creating interactive GUIâ€™s in an effective manner and as well as handling those events easily. It provides a range of functions or widgets to work with.
